## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or newer)  
- npm (v8+) or yarn  
- Electron-compatible environment  
- Google Chrome (for first-time WhatsApp Web QR login)

### Installation & Usage

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ShobhitMaste/Whatsapp-Broadcast.git
cd Whatsapp-Broadcast

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Launch in development
npm run dev

# Build a distributable version
npm run build
```

Once launched, scan the WhatsApp QR code to link your WhatsApp Web session to the app.

## How It Works

1. Electron boots up the desktop shell and loads your React-based interface.  
2. `preload.js` sets up a secure context bridge for UI-to-Automation communication.  
3. Message queues are managed via the UI and dispatched through `script.js` logic.  
4. The automation supports unsaved numbers by using WhatsApp Web URL logic.

---

## Limitations & Compliance

- This project does **not** integrate with the official WhatsApp Business API; it relies on browser automation via an active WhatsApp Web session.  
- WhatsApp may require your number to be saved in recipients' contacts for some bulk messaging features to work fully.  
- Use responsiblyâ€”automated messaging at scale can violate WhatsApp Terms of Service and may lead to account blocks.

---

## Use Cases

- Sending appointment reminders or updates to unsaved numbers  
- Group messaging for marketing or outreach without manual contact entry  
- Internal team notifications via WhatsApp Web interface
- Use for marketing of a business
